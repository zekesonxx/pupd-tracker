# PUPD Data Tracker
After concerns about the way the Purdue University Police Department updates their data, I've decided to start tracking exactly what they say.
This script runs every four hours and records everything the PUPD claims on their website.

* Motivated By: [Following a suicide, Purdue quiets social-media backlash after PUPD falsely reports 3 - Purdue Exponent](https://www.purdueexponent.org/campus/article_d0d0d5b2-29f1-11eb-a243-a7b5f5a651ca.html)
