<p><strong><a id="III"></a>III. Daily Crime Log&#160; <br/></strong></p>
<p>University Police create, maintain and preserve a daily log, written in a form that can be easily understood, that records any crime or alleged crime that occurred within the Cleary Act reportable geography or the University Police Department&#8217;s patrol jurisdiction. The log includes the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>The nature (classification/title) of the crime,</li>
<li>The case report number,</li>
<li>The date and time the crime was to have occurred,</li>
<li>The date and time the crime was reported,</li>
<li>The general location of each crime or alleged crime and</li>
<li>The disposition of the complaint, if known.</li>
</ol>
<p>The daily crime log is required to include all reported crimes, additions and changes in disposition within 60 days of the original report and to be posted within two business days of the University Police receiving the report.</p>
<p>The only exceptions to these requirements are:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the disclosure is prohibited by law , or&#160;&#160;</li>
<li>If the disclosure would jeopardize the confidentiality of the victim.</li>
</ol>
<p>The records unit of the University Police Department may temporarily withhold the posting of a reported crime only if there is clear and convincing evidence that the release of the information would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jeopardize an ongoing investigation,</li>
<li>Jeopardize the safety of an individual,&#160;&#160;</li>
<li>Cause a suspect to flee or evade detection, or&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
<li>Result in destruction of evidence.&#160;&#160;&#160;</li>
</ol>
<p>The individual with responsibility for determining whether information is withheld from the log documents in writing the basis for withholding information from the log and maintains a copy of the documentation in a secure file. The withheld information must be disclosed once the adverse effects described above are no longer likely to occur.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Daily crime logs containing the most recent 60 days are maintained by the department&#8217;s records unit for public inspection upon request and are posted on the University Police Department&#8217;s website. An archive of log information for the previous seven years is maintained and made available upon request within two business days.</p>
