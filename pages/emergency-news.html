<br />
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Purdue University announced Monday (Feb. 15) that all in-person class meetings on the West Lafayette campus should be canceled or moved online on Tuesday (Feb. 16). A significant amount of snow and deteriorating conditions have made travel unsafe for faculty, staff, and off campus students, prompting the decision. Note that planned virtual meetings of online/hybrid courses should continue as scheduled.<br />
<br />
Instructors of impacted courses should communicate plans and expectations (e.g due dates, remote meeting methods, exams/quizzes) directly to students. Students should check their email and Brightspace frequently for updates from their instructors.  The first Reading Day of the semester will be held as scheduled on Wednesday (Feb. 17).<br />
<br />
Predesignated essential personnel should operate under their department procedures. Nonessential personnel should work remotely if possible and not report to campus for any shifts between 5 p.m. Monday  (Feb. 15) and 5 p.m. Tuesday (Feb. 16). The campus <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/ehps/emergency_preparedness/docs/FY%2021%20Winter%20adverse%20weather%20memo.pdf">adverse weather procedures are available online</a> (pdf). <br />
<br />
University officials continue to monitor area road conditions - and encourage employees to do the same - to be aware of any local travel restrictions that might remain in place. Those planning to travel on area roads should monitor their county travel status at <a href="https://www.in.gov/dhs/traveladvisory/">https://www.in.gov/dhs/traveladvisory/</a>. <br />
