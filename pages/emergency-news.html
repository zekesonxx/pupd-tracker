<p style="font-family:acumin-pro-condensed,'Franklin Gothic', Arial, sans-serif; font-size:1.1em;">At approximately 10:21 p.m. on Feb. 1, Purdue police received a 911 call from a 19-year-old male Purdue student who stated he had been shot by what he believed was a white bb gun with an orange tip. <br />
<br />
The victim says as he was walking on the sidewalk near the intersection of State and Russell streets, a darker green or gray GMC extended cab pickup truck (possibly 2-tone) drove by him with 3 male passengers in the front seat. The victim stated he was shot by a blonde male, who was sitting in the middle of the front seat, with the white bb gun. The victim sustained minor injuries to his lip but declined medical treatment. The suspect vehicle was last seen headed west on State Street and was believed to have turned NB onto Martin Jischke Drive.<br />
<br />
Purdue University police have a photo of the suspected vehicle and are investigating with assistance from West Lafayette City police.<br />
<br />
Anyone with information is asked to call PUPD or WLPD.<br />
<br />
· Stay together. Do not walk alone at night. Travel in groups and in well-lit areas. Look for Blue Light Emergency phones<br />
· Be alert. Maintaining awareness of your surroundings is critical, especially when traveling at night. Wearing headphones or looking at your phone diminishes your ability to respond to your surroundings. Walk with purpose, and stay attentive.<br />
· Trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Call police if something looks odd — we're happy to assist, and even the smallest bit of information could prevent another crime.<br />
· Watch out for each other. Call 911 immediately if you or someone else is in danger. The University encourages students to take appropriate action to protect others’ safety by reducing students’ fear of legal or disciplinary consequences to the victim or themselves. <br />
· If you choose to consume alcohol, please be responsible. Remember your ability to respond is diminished by overconsumption of alcohol.<br />
