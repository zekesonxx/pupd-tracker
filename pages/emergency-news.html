<h2 style="color:#8e6f3e; font-family:acumin-pro-condensed,'Franklin Gothic',Arial,sans-serif; font-size:1.7em;">Snow Emergency: Purdue cancels in-person class meetings for Thursday (Feb. 3) due to heavy snow; nonessential employees should not report for campus shifts</h2><base target="_blank" />
<p style="font-family:acumin-pro-condensed,'Franklin Gothic', Arial, sans-serif; font-size:1.1em;">Purdue University announced Wednesday (Feb. 2) that all in-person class meetings on the West Lafayette campus should be moved online if possible or canceled on Thursday (Feb. 3) and that all nonessential personnel should work remotely if possible. Forecasts call for continued heavy snow and deteriorating conditions, which may make travel unsafe for faculty, staff, and off-campus students, prompting the decision. Note that planned virtual meetings of online/hybrid courses may continue as scheduled.<br />
<br />
Purdue administrators and public safety officials are working with city and county personnel to actively monitor the winter storm, and they ask everyone to remain aware of changing conditions. The campus operating status for Friday (Feb. 4) will be communicated via email, social media and area media as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Instructors of impacted courses should communicate plans and expectations (e.g due dates, remote meeting methods, exams/quizzes) directly to students. Students should check their email and Brightspace frequently for updates from their instructors.<br />
<br />
Predesignated essential personnel should operate under their department procedures. Nonessential personnel should work remotely if possible and not report to campus for any shifts between 4 p.m. Wednesday (Feb. 2) and 11:59 p.m. Thursday (Feb. 3). The campus adverse weather procedures are available online (pdf).<br />
<br />
University officials continue to monitor area road conditions - and encourage employees to do the same - to be aware of any local travel restrictions that might remain in place. Those planning to travel on area roads should monitor their county travel status. <br />
<br />
To check on the status of CityBus operations, you can download the app or search for the MyCityBus app in the Google Play or Apple App Store, or check the CityBus website.<br />
<br />
Purdue officials also are working in conjunction with local and state emergency responders to provide assistance locally. <br />

Any additional updates will be available on the Purdue campus emergency page.<br />
