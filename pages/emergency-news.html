<p style="font-family:acumin-pro-condensed,'Franklin Gothic', Arial, sans-serif; font-size:1.1em;">Oct. 30, 2021<br />

The West Lafayette City Police Department is investigating an alleged sexual assault that was reported to have occurred late Friday night (10/29/21) or early Saturday morning (10/30/21) in the 300 block of North Grant Street. Anyone with information should contact WLPD at 765-775-5200.<br />
Sexual assault is non-consensual activity, ranging from unwanted touching to forced intercourse (which can include sexual contact with someone who is impaired by alcohol, drugs, or any other intoxicant that impairs their judgment).<br />
<br />
Always seek verbal, sober, and clear consent. Immediately stop sexual advances if the other person indicates no interest or if they say “no.” Consent to one sexual act does not imply consent to another. The absence of “no” does not mean “yes.” Pressuring or coercing someone into engaging in sexual activity is sexual assault.<br />
<br />
Though the victim of a crime is not at fault, many crimes can be prevented by small acts:<br />
<br />
Always be cautious when meeting someone you do not know, in person or online.<br />
Utilize the buddy system with a friend you trust. If a friend seems too intoxicated, get him or her to a safe place immediately.<br />
Seek medical help immediately if a friend starts to exhibit symptoms of dizziness, nausea, memory loss, breathing or motion difficulties, or is acting disproportionately intoxicated relative to the amount of alcohol.<br />
If you are involved in, or a witness to, a situation that appears unsafe or makes you uncomfortable, intervene if it’s safe to do so, elicit help from a friend, or go to a safe area and call for help.<br />
If you get up to move or use the restroom, always bring your drink with you. Watch your drink at all times.<br />
