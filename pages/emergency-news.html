Aggravated Assault Safety Tips:<br />
 <br />
• Keep emergency numbers pre-programmed into your cell phone.<br />
 <br />
• If you are faced with demands for your money or property, especially from an armed subject, comply with their demands in the interest of your safety.<br />
 <br />
• Do not prop doors to buildings open. Prevent ‘tailgating’ by closing all doors and gates behind you when entering or leaving.<br />
 <br />
• Walk in lighted corridors on campus when possible. Use Safe Walk. Call 494-SAFE for escort.<br />
 <br />
• Be aware of blue light emergency telephones. They are a direct line to help.<br />
 <br />
• Walk confidently, directly, and at a steady pace. Don’t stop to talk to strangers.<br />
 <br />
• Always be aware of your surroundings. Avoid headphone and cell phone use when walking or waiting alone.<br />
 <br />
• Report any suspicious activity or person immediately by calling or texting 9-1-1.<br />
 <br />
• If harassed or assaulted, scream and attempt to run for safety or go into an open business, and ask for help.<br />
